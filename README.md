   I am API savvy so I wanted to make an app to demonstrate this and to have something for my friends and family to use also. This fetches data from the CocktailDb, free with some limitations; CocktailDb is an open source database providing instructions and ingredients for making cocktails. This page offers search options, browsing by letter, and if you have an ingredient at the house, you can find the ingredient in the list to see all the drinks that are possible. I hope if you go to check it out, you find a drink to make this weekend that is different and satisfying. I like to mix things up a bit and explore what the world has to offer, I encourage it.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project uses an API to fetch data from [CocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/). I used React and Sass to create the page and host it on Netlify. I wanted to make this as quick as possible, as performance is always on the top of my mind. I learned alot about using Webpack, lazy loading and how to optimize your build. There were a load of features I would have liked to add but didn't want to dish out the money for full access. I would consider one of my strong suits as working with data, whether it be by building or using APIs or creating applications to manage data.

### Built With

* React
* Sass
* Netlify
